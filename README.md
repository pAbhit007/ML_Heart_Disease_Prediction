# ML_Heart_Disease_Prediction

#### Data collection and preparation:
Data is collected from various sources, including medical records and databases.
Data is cleaned and preprocessed to remove any inconsistencies or errors.

#### Feature selection:
Features are selected based on their relevance to heart disease prediction.
Features are chosen using statistical methods or domain expertise.

#### Data splitting:
The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets.
This division is carried out to evaluate the model's performance effectively.

#### Model training:
The machine learning model is trained using the training dataset.
During training, the model learns the patterns and relationships in the data.

#### Model evaluation:
The model's performance is assessed using the validation dataset.
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are calculated.

#### Hyperparameter tuning:
Hyperparameters are adjusted to optimize the model's performance.
This process is guided by the validation results.

#### Model testing:
The final trained model is tested on the separate testing dataset.
This step provides an estimate of how well the model will perform on unseen data.

#### Predictions:
The trained model is used to make predictions on new, unseen data.
These predictions can be used for heart disease risk assessment.

## Deployment

#### Selection of Deployment Environment:
The deployment environment is carefully chosen based on factors like scalability, security, and resource availability.
Considerations are made for cloud platforms, on-premises servers, or edge devices depending on the specific requirements of the application.

#### Installation of Required Software:
Necessary software dependencies and libraries are installed in the chosen deployment environment.
This ensures that the environment is prepared for running the machine learning model.

#### Model Serialization:
The trained machine learning model is serialized into a format suitable for deployment.
Serialization prepares the model for efficient storage and transport.

#### Integration with Streamlit:
The Streamlit framework is integrated into the deployment environment.
Streamlit is a user-friendly Python library for creating web applications with minimal effort.

#### Ongoing Maintenance and Updates:
Regular maintenance and updates are performed to keep the deployed system secure and up-to-date, including the Streamlit web app.

#### Error Handling and Issue Resolution:
Procedures are in place to handle errors and issues that may arise during deployment, including those related to the Streamlit application.
